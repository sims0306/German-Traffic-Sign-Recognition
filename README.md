# Assignment 2: Deep_Learning

Since the code is written and tested on Kaggle due to the availability of GPUs for faster optimization and better integration of the huge dataset of 43 traffic signs consisting of 39209 images, it is recommended to use Kaggle notebook for the processing of the models by inputing data of "gtsrb-german-traffic-sign" (found at [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/)) before running as it would add data without actually downloading it on your local and makes it convenient to compile and test.

Kaggle Notebook can be opened at: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/](https://www.kaggle.com/code/)

## Please use the below config:
* Input Data: gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
* Accelerator: GPU P-100
* Language: Python
